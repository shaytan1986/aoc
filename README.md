# Advent of Code

This is my repo for tracking the challenges for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I've got it organized by year, and then challenge. Note, it might have been better for me to do it by day, since there are two challenges per day, but I didn't realize that when I started. So Day 1 = 01 + 02, Day 2 = 03 + 04, etc.

The folder `.\scratch` is just a place for random scripts where I need some, well, scratch space.

My general MO is to, in each folder, add:

* Any input data
* Any _test_ input data
* A `script.py` file which runs the actual analysis
* A command line argument `t` you can provide to tell the script to use the test data instead of the real data
* In each method, I try to document what I was doing pretty thoroughly.

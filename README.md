# Advent of Code

This is my repo for tracking the challenges for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I've got it organized by year, and then challenge. Note, it might have been better for me to do it by day, since there are two challenges per day, but I didn't realize that when I started. So Day 1 = 01 + 02, Day 2 = 03 + 04, etc.

The folder `.\scratch` is just a place for random scripts where I need some, well, scratch space.
